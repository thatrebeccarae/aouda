# Aouda

**A security-first personal AI agent.** Single-user, self-hosted, 42 tools, 9,500 lines of TypeScript, 11 production dependencies, OWASP ASI-aligned. Telegram-native with Gmail, Calendar, browser automation, RSS, workflow orchestration, and Claude Code handoff -- all with human-in-the-loop approval.

## Why I Built Aouda

Most personal AI agents are either toys or liability. Toy projects answer questions and maybe send a Slack message. Framework agents hand an LLM unrestricted shell access, call it "autonomous," and hope for the best.

Aouda started after [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) -- the most starred open-source agent framework -- shipped [8 CVEs in 60 days](https://www.securityweek.com/openclaw-security-issues-continue-as-secureclaw-open-source-tool-debuts/), a [supply chain attack](https://www.scworld.com/brief/massive-openclaw-supply-chain-attack-floods-openclaw-with-malicious-skills) hit 300,000 users through its skill marketplace, and a [Kaspersky audit](https://cybersecuritynews.com/openclaw-2026-2-12-released/) found 512 vulnerabilities in the codebase.

Aouda is an alternative -- same core functionality without the attack surface. Single-user, single-operator, 42 tools. Every external data path wrapped in content boundaries. Every shell command through a 4-layer permission system. Claude Code handoff with remote control sessions. Dangerous operations require human approval via Telegram. No remote skill loading, no marketplace, no multi-tenancy.

An active project and open-sourced as-is. Fork it, gut it, make it yours.

---

## Philosophy

**Security is architectural, not patchable.** You can't bolt security onto 430,000 lines of code with 49 dependencies and a remote skill marketplace. Aouda was built security-first from line one.

**Single-user is a feature.** Multi-tenant AI agents are an unsolved problem. When an agent has access to email, files, and shell commands, sharing context between users turns every prompt injection into a cross-tenant data breach. One operator, one trust boundary.

**Everything degrades gracefully.** No Gmail credentials? Gmail tools are disabled. No Docker? Sandbox falls back to the lightweight allow-list. No Miniflux? RSS features are skipped. The agent starts with whatever you configure and cleanly disables the rest.

**No remote skill loading.** Skills are local `.ts` files, tested and vetted and loaded at boot. No marketplace, no runtime downloads, no supply chain risk from community-contributed code.

**Human-in-the-loop by default.** Bash commands, Claude Code operations, and dangerous tool calls route to the operator for approval via Telegram. The agent asks before it acts.

**Multi-provider, not locked in.** Four LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) with tier-based routing. Simple queries hit cheap models. Complex reasoning hits the best available. If a provider goes down, the router falls back automatically.

## How Aouda Compares

Different tools, different trade-offs. [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) optimizes for breadth. [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) optimizes for container isolation. Aouda optimizes for minimal attack surface.

| | Aouda | OpenClaw | NanoClaw |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lines of code** | 9,500 | 430,000+ | ~2,500 core |
| **Production dependencies** | 11 | 49 | ~15 |
| **Tools** | 42 | 25 built-in + marketplace | Claude Code's full toolset |
| **CVEs (lifetime)** | 0 | 8+ | 0 |
| **Remote skill loading** | No | Yes (ClawHub) | No |
| **LLM providers** | 4 (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) | 14 | 1 (Claude) |
| **Channels** | 2 (Telegram, Slack) | 14+ | 5 |
| **Content boundaries** | Yes (all external data paths) | No | No |
| **Injection detection** | Yes (pattern-based + heightened security mode) | No | No |
| **Sandbox** | 2-tier (lightweight + Docker) | Optional Docker | Mandatory container |
| **Proactive monitoring** | 5 monitors (inbox, Docker, calendar, heartbeat, RSS) | Via extensions | No |
| **Voice** | No | Yes | Yes (via Whisper) |
| **Mobile app** | No (Telegram) | Yes (iOS, Android) | No (Telegram) |
| **Community** | Solo build | 852 contributors, 247K stars | Solo build, 19K stars |

What's in the missing 420,500 lines? Attack surface.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thatrebeccarae/aouda.git
cd aouda
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env        # add your API keys and Telegram bot token
cp config/soul.example.md config/soul.md   # customize personality
pnpm dev
```

**Requirements:**
- **macOS** -- developed and tested on macOS (Apple Silicon). Linux should work but is untested. Windows is not supported.
- Node.js >= 22
- pnpm
- A Telegram bot token ([BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- At least one LLM API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Gemini) -- or a running Ollama instance

The agent starts with only what you configure. No Gmail credentials? Gmail tools
are disabled. No Miniflux? RSS features are skipped. Everything degrades
gracefully.

> **Note:** A `pnpm setup` wizard is planned but not yet implemented. For now,
> edit `.env` manually.

## Personality

Aouda uses a `soul.md` file to define the agent's personality, voice, values,
and behavioral boundaries. This file is loaded into the system prompt.

```bash
cp config/soul.example.md config/soul.md
```

The example file includes:

- **Voice** -- Tone, verbosity preferences, formatting rules
- **Values** -- Priority-ordered value hierarchy (safety > mission > honesty > autonomy > efficiency)
- **Boundaries** -- Hard limits on credential exposure, infrastructure disclosure, destructive actions
- **Tool behavior** -- Rules about how to use tools (summarize, don't dump raw data)
- **Anti-patterns** -- Explicitly banned behaviors (sycophancy, filler, emotional performance)

Edit `soul.md` to match your preferences. The agent's personality is entirely
defined here -- there's no hardcoded persona in the source code.

## Security

Defense-in-depth, informed by the [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (2026)](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/) -- 8 of 10 categories fully mitigated, 2 partial.

- **Content boundaries** -- Every external data path (email, web, RSS, calendar, webhooks) wrapped in security markers before it reaches the LLM
- **Injection detection** -- Pattern matching with heightened security mode (30 min of manual approval for all Bash commands)
- **4-layer Bash permissions** -- Blocked → heightened → safe prefixes → Telegram approval
- **2-tier sandbox** -- Lightweight allow-list + Docker (`--network none`, `--cap-drop ALL`)
- **SSRF protection** -- Fail-closed DNS validation, private IP blocking, DNS rebinding defense
- **Single-user model** -- One operator, one trust boundary, no multi-tenancy

See `SECURITY.md` for the full threat model and mitigation details.
